This roadmap document shows an overview of our project priorities.
It is non-binding and is only useful to have a simple overview of where we are, and where we might be going.


This document is feature focused, so many tasks that support the objectives below, won't be shown.
For a more detailed look at progression through these milestones, please refer to Trello and the Sprint planning documents.
The roadmap should evolve over time as it is primarily an overview, and not a planning document.
